<h1>Certified measurement</h1>
<p>The certified measurement allows you to make conclusive statements about the quality of your Internet access. These findings serve as the basis for a so-called "prima facie proof" of certain warranty aspects in case of a fixed Internet access from an Austrian provider. The certified measurement only states facts. Whether a contract-compliant service is provided or not, is therefore always up to the deciding entity. This could be a court or the <a href="https://www.rtr.at/en/tk/TKKS_Schlichtung01"  target="_blank"> conciliation body </a> of RTR-GmbH.</p>

<h2>Process of a certified measurement</h2>
<p>
    A measuring cycle lasts at least two hours. During this period, individual measurements are carried out automatically every 15 minutes. At least three measurement cycles must be performed on three different days within a timeframe of two weeks in order to get a certified measurement.
